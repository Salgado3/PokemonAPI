#Got to Catch 'em all 

This is an ongoing project using the API https://pokeapi.co/. It's a guessing game. Currently you can guess a random pokemon's weight. Similar to the carnival games of yesteryear... You would step on a massive scale (probably used for weighing fridges). A stranger would eyeball you and try and guess your weight and would write it down on a piece of paper. You would then say your weight in hopes of winning a stuffed teddy bear (in this case, a Shiny Pokemon)... wait, why did I pay $10 for that?

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript


## Optimizations

Eventually, I would like to have a functioning pokedex that would allow users to collect shiny pokemon. That will be build using some backend frameworks. Local memory could work in the meantime, but let's do it right off the bat.


## Lessons Learned:

Carnival games are odd. More importantly, reading through API documentation is both challenging and rewarding. Usually there vast pieces of information that can be used to manipulate the DOM, it's just a matter of pulling it out..

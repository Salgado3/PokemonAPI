#Got to Catch 'em all 

This is an ongoing project using the API https://pokeapi.co/. It's a guessing game. Currently you can guess a random pokemon's weight. Similar to the carnival games of yesteryear... You would step on a massive scale (probably used for weighing fridges). A stranger would eyeball you and try and guess your weight and would write it down on a piece of paper. You would then say your weight in hopes of winning a stuffed teddy bear... wait, why did I pay $10 for this?
